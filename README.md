## Description

The mechanical bidomain model is a new mathematical description of the elastic behavior of cardiac tissue. Its primary advantage over previous models is that it accounts for forces acting across the cell membrane arising form differences in the displacement of the intracellular and extracellular spaces. 
In this problem we are trying to capture the behaviour of biological tissues when there is a gradient in their mechanical properties.
